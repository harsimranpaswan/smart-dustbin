# smart-dustbin
This is a very simple project where I have created a smart dustbin using only 3 components, that are - ARDUINO UNO, SERVO MOTOR and ULTRASONIC SENSOR.
The dustboin opens automatically whenever someone comes in front of it (anywhere between 20 cms) without touching. The code, circuit diagram and demo video is provided.
